o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
	The overall passing rate 90.6% when compared to other schools where the 9th grade scores were not removed is high, indicating that at least for the upper grades the reading and math programs are highly successful
o	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
	Math and reading scores by grade
	Overall when compared to other schools the senior high grades are not affected and if we assume that the 9th grade data that was removed would be the same as the other 9th grade programs then it too would appear in the 80th percentile.
